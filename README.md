# Algorithms
These are some Algortihms, and projects that I used to practice Problem Solving. These algorithms are like recursive, iterative algorithms like Fibbonaci Sequence, Factorial Generator and more. Other Algorithms I plan to implement Sorting Algorithms and Searching Algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Linear Search, Binary Search.
